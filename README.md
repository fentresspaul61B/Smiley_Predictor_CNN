# Hand Drawn Smiley Face Prediction with Convolutional Neural Network (Keras TensorFlow) üôÇ üôÅ
 
Hello!
 
In this computer vision project, I wanted to see if I could train a model to distinguish
my own hand drawn smiley faces vs. sad faces, using computer vision and image classification.
 
## Model
Data pre-processing and model building is done in the:
**image_pixel_reduction.ipynb** file.
 
## Web App
The deployed web app is in the **UI.py** file.
 
 
## Project Specs
- Model written and trained in Google Colab. Web app deployed using
    Python + Streamlit.
- Collected 800 hand-drawn smiley faces and sad faces (400 of each).
- Used Keras Data Augmentation to generate a **dataset of 80,000 images**.
- Trained **Convolutional Neural Network** that could classify sad vs smiley faces with **99% accuracy**.
- Deployed the model as a web app using **Streamlit**.
