# Hand Drawn Smiley Face Prediction with Convolutional Neural Network (Keras Tensor Flow) üôÇ üôÅ

Hello! 

In this computer vision project, I wanted to see if I could train a model to distinguish 
my own hand drawn smiley faces vs. sad faces, using computer vision and image classifcation. 


# Project Specs 
- Model written and trained in Google Colab.
- Collected 800 hand-drawn smiley faces and sad faces (400 of each). 
- Used Keras Data Augmentation to generate a **dataset of 80,000 images**. 
- Trained **Convolutional Neural Network** that could classify sad vs smiley faces with **99% accuracy**. 
- Deployed the model as a web app using **Streamlit**.
